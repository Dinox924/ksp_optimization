# ksp_optimization

This project aims to compare the theoretical delta-V for a trip to the Mun in Kerbal Space Program with the actual delta-V of one of my flights. Additionally, I will optimize the delta-V by tweaking various parameters using the gradient descent method (specifically the Armijo rule).
